His AI-focused angles (\"AI Agents,\" \"Replaced My Team\") resonate strongly \u2014 his December 2024 video alone generated 520K views and 1,800 conversions.\n\nThomas Frank Explains delivers the strongest mid-funnel engagement, with notably high click-through rates on Notion integration content. His audience skews toward productivity enthusiasts who convert well.\n\n**What's Working**\n\n- AI + automation angles dominate: videos mentioning \"AI\" in the title average 2.3x more views than non-AI titles\n- December and April are peak months \u2014 likely driven by \"year in review\" and \"new year\" planning content cycles\n- TOFU content generates volume, but MOFU content (Notion, productivity stacks) drives better conversion rates per view\n\n**What Needs Attention**\n\n- Avi Singh's channel has shown declining engagement since mid-2025 \u2014 consider refreshing the content brief or adjusting investment\n- June-August 2025 saw a significant dip across all creators \u2014 summer seasonality may require adjusted posting schedules\n- BOFU content is underrepresented (only 12% of posts) \u2014 consider commissioning more comparison and migration-focused videos\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nDouble down on Corbin Brown's AI agent content for TOFU, shift Thomas Frank toward more MOFU conversion-focused videos, and pilot a BOFU series with Nicole van der Hoeven focused on enterprise use cases and technical integrations.","monthly":{"2024-10":"October 2024 marked a solid start with 188K views across 4 posts. **Corbin Brown's automation overview** led the pack at 85K views. The channel mix was well-balanced across funnel stages. Key opportunity: the \"Zapier vs Make\" comparison by Thomas Frank drove strong engagement \u2014 competitive comparison content clearly resonates with the audience.","2024-12":"**Breakout month.** December 2024 was the first million-view month (1.14M total), driven almost entirely by Corbin Brown's AI agent video (520K views, 1,800 conversions). This single post accounted for 51% of the month's conversions. Thomas Frank's \"Ultimate Tutorial\" also performed well at 310K views. The AI narrative clearly hit at the right time \u2014 end-of-year planning + AI hype cycle convergence.","2025-02":"February 2025 was the **highest-performing month to date** at 2.48M views. Corbin Brown's viral hit about replacing his team with AI agents drove 1.2M views alone. However, conversion rates were notably lower (0.02% vs December's 0.31%) \u2014 suggesting the content attracted a broader but less intent-driven audience. Consider adding stronger CTAs to viral TOFU content.","2025-04":"April 2025 peaked at **4.49M views** \u2014 the all-time high. Corbin Brown (2.1M) and Thomas Frank (1.4M) both produced viral hits. The YouTube automation angle by Thomas Frank was particularly clever \u2014 teaching automation to an audience that already creates content. Conversion rates remained modest at 0.017%, reinforcing the need for better MOFU follow-up.","2025-05":"May 2025 delivered strong click numbers (**17.3K clicks** \u2014 highest ever) despite lower views than April. Corbin Brown's business-building angle resonated differently, attracting a more commercially-minded audience. Avi Singh's Power Automate comparison was a smart competitive play. The click-to-view ratio of 1.0% was the best we've seen.","2026-01":"January 2026 started strong with 1.94M views. The \"2026 trends\" angle worked well for Corbin Brown (980K views). Nicole van der Hoeven's DevOps content, while lower in raw views, attracted a highly technical audience \u2014 consider tracking demo requests separately for BOFU content like this."},"channelRecommendations":[{"channel":"Corbin Brown","recommendation":"Create a \"Build Your Own AI Assistant\" step-by-step tutorial using Zapier Central + Claude","rationale":"Corbin's AI-focused content consistently outperforms (2.3x avg views).

A comprehensive masterclass would serve the MOFU audience already engaging with his shorter content and push them toward conversion. Longer content also performs well on YouTube's algorithm."},{"channel":"Nicole van der Hoeven","recommendation":"Create a \"Zapier for QA Engineers: Automated Testing Pipeline\" series (3 parts)","rationale":"Nicole's technical audience converts at the highest rate per view. A multi-part series on testing automation would deepen engagement with her existing DevOps-oriented viewers and create a natural BOFU pipeline for enterprise Zapier plans."},{"channel":"Avi Singh - PowerBIPro","recommendation":"Pivot to \"Excel Power Users \u2192 Zapier\" migration content with side-by-side comparisons","rationale":"Avi's Power BI audience is deeply embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem.
